                    <li>The chart is <strong>annotated with major events </strong>that may have impacted the number of movie releases over the years</li>
                    <li>As you can see, around the 30's movies started to pick up in production due to the rise of sound in films.
                        Furthermore, the Rise of HollyWood saw stars start to gain fame which only increased the fuel to movie making.
                        Around the 2000's, film making technology became better which made movies much easier to make. There were also many breakout stars
                        in this era that only propeled the industry. With the rise of streaming services, people could enjoy films at home and smaller film makers
                        could now easily publish their movies and have easier access to an audience. A slight decrease in movie making was seen in 2020 due to COVID-19 and again
                        in 2023 due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Overall there is an exponential increase in movies and has not shown signs of plateau. This trend may continue due to
                        previous trend and the continuous increase of aspiring film directors.
