                    <li>The data was sourced from <i>The Movie DataBase (TMDB.org)</i></li>
                    <li>The data was then pulled with an api call to this kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies</li>
                    <li>Since the database is extremely large, a sample of it was used. Movies cut off at <i>October 2023</i>. To determine this the following criteria were used: </li>
                    <li> -- English Movies were considered</li>
                    <li> -- Only those movies with a rating and at least 1 review were considered</li>
                    <li> -- Movies with duration longer than 30 mins and less than 7 hours were considered. Somes movies could be represented as a part 1 & 2 in one so that duration was considered.</li>
                    <li> -- Only movies with the "released" status were considerd.</li>
                    <li>The Alteryx flow used to clean the data can be found in the Github repo</li>
